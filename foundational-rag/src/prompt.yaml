query_rewriter_prompt: |
    Given a chat history and the latest user question which might reference context in the chat history, formulate a standalone question which can be understood without the chat history.
    Do NOT answer the question, just reformulate it if needed and otherwise return it as is.
    It should strictly be a query not an answer.
