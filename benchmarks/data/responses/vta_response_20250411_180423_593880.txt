Let's break it down. Convergent boundaries occur when plates collide, forming mountains, volcanoes, and earthquakes. Divergent boundaries, on the other hand, happen when plates move apart, leading to the creation of rifts, mid-ocean ridges, and volcanic activity. Transform boundaries involve lateral sliding, resulting in faults and mountain building. Can you think of an example where these differences might impact the formation of a specific landform?
