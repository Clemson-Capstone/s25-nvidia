you will be expected to be able to apply basic statics to time series data (e.g., a set of Round 
Trip Times). This includes being able to plot the probability distribution (PDF) of a data set. 
There will be a very brief review of this material.
You should be familiar with Linux/Unix, and be comfortable writing "C" programs in a Linux 
environment.
