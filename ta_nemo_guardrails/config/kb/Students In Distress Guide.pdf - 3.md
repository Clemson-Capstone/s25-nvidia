# Students In Distress Guide.pdf - 3

LISTEN CAREFULLY
Students in distress need to be seen and heard. Be sure to use a calm voice and 
respond in a way that affirms the student’s feelings. Avoid any language that is 
threatening, humiliating or intimidating.
BE PROACTIVE
Engage students early and encourage them to seek out support on or off campus 
and set expectations for appropriate behavior.
FOLLOW THROUGH
Help to connect students with resources and support. File a CARE report if you are 
unsure a student has followed through on making contact with support.
ASK FOR HELP
If you are unsure of appropriate steps for supporting a student in need, consult with 
the appropriate support areas and/or contact the Office of Advocacy and Success 
by phone or review our website for resources. See contacts in this document.
The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and other privacy laws 
may prevent University officials from reporting to referral sources the outcome of 
student reports.
