I encourage you to test your autograder incrementally using the two student submissions that will 
be on Canvas. Student 1’s submission should fail the magic squares test cases (think about why 
that’s the case, there’s a few reasons), and student 2’s submission should pass all test cases. 
Submission: 
 Zip your autograder files and folders 
 Name the zipped file Autograder‐<lastname>.zip, replacing the end with your last 
name. 
 Submit this file to the correct Canvas assignment for us to review and go over next 
week. 
Helpful Notes: 
 The autograder video linked on Canvas will help you get started and show you more 
in-depth how to set up the autograder, run it, and write test cases. 
 If you need help or have questions, feel free to ask in the Teams channel for this class 
or the Autograder Help channel
