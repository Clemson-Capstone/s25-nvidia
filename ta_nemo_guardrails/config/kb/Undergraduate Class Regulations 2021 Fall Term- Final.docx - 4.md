Academic IntegrityParagraph 49
When, in the opinion of a course instructor, there is evidence that a student has committed an act of academic dishonesty, the instructor must make a formal written charge of academic dishonesty, including a description of the misconduct to Dr. Jeff Appling, Senior Associate Dean of Undergraduate Studies. The reporting instructor may, at his/her discretion, inform each involved student privately of the nature of the alleged charge. In cases of plagiarism (I.B.2.) instructors may use the Plagiarism Resolution Form available from the Office of Undergraduate Studies. Instructors using this form for the first time must consult with Dr. Jeff Appling (japplin@clemson.edu) prior to meeting with the student.Paragraph 51
Instructors suspecting a violation of the academic integrity policy should not assign a grade penalty until the process is complete. For suspected academic dishonesty outside the course setting, please consult with Dr. Appling.Paragraph 53
Instructors should include a class policy on submission of work that has been turned in for credit for a previous course.Paragraph 55
Please email UGSintegrity@clemson.edu with any questions about academic integrity.Paragraph 57
Mid-term GradesParagraph 58
No later than ten days before the last day students can drop courses without receiving final grades (October 26), instructors of every undergraduate course shall make available for each student: (a) the student’s numerical course grade, or (b) that student’s letter ranking to date in that course (A-F or P/NP). Feedback that is more frequent is strongly encouraged.Paragraph 60
Both student and instructor are to recognize that this feedback reflects the student’s performance up to that point in time, and as such, that student’s final course grade may change based upon subsequent coursework performance(s).Paragraph 62
