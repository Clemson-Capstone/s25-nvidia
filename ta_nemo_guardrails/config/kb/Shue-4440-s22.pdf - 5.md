you must give appropriate credit to those collaborators and/or sources. As long as you acknowledge the
collaboration that occurred, your grade will not be affected nor will you be charged with academic
misconduct. On the other hand, a failure to acknowledge collaborations or give appropriate credit to
sources of help (other than course materials or personnel as noted above) will be treated as plagiarism.Page 6
In general, collaboration is permitted on labs, homework and exercises and on out of class projects with
the consideration that all collaboration is to be acknowledged as above. However, in-class exams and
quizzes are to be taken on your own with no help from any friends, electronics, or notes.
Academic Integrity
As members of the Clemson University community, we have inherited Thomas Green Clemson’s vision
of this institution as a “high seminary of learning.” Fundamental to this vision is a mutual commitment to
truthfulness, honor, and responsibility, without which we cannot earn the trust and respect of others.
Furthermore, we recognize that academic dishonesty detracts from the value of a Clemson degree.
Therefore, we shall not tolerate lying, cheating, or stealing in any form.
All infractions of academic dishonesty by undergraduates must be reported to Undergraduate Studies for
resolution through that office. In cases of plagiarism instructors may use the Plagiarism Resolution Form.
See the Undergraduate Academic Integrity Policy (https://www.clemson.edu/academics/integrity/)
website for additional information and the current catalog (https://catalog.clemson.edu/index.php?
catoid=33) for the policy.
For graduate students, see the current graduate student handbook
(https://www.clemson.edu/graduate/students/policies-procedures/index.html) for all policies.
