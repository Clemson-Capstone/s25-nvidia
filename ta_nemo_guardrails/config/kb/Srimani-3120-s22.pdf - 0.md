Motivation: We live in an exciting era thanks to ever-increasing advancements in communication and 
computing technologies. Consider, for example, how big data mining and DNA analysis have affected 
modern medicine, or smart search algorithms have made instantaneous availability of accurate 
information possible, or how cell phones, twitter, social networks have influenced political and social 
events.
An Interesting Simple Quiz: Compute median of 5 arbitrary distinct integers 
using less than or equal to 6 comparisons
Course Objectives: The objective in this class is for students to become familiar with Algorithms 
Design and Analysis concepts. The student who completes this course:

• shall get familiar with techniques of analyzing different algorithms theoretically as well as in real 
life settings of diverse application domains.
• shall be able to implement algorithms using a programming language and evaluate their 
comparative performance.
• shall get an understanding of how algorithms form a powerful lens through which to view 
problem solving in general.
