assembler
• Explain different instruction formats, such as address per instruction
• Describe the principles of memory management and memory hierarchy
A brief list of topics that maybe covered (time permitted):
1. A Tour of Computer Systems – compilation systems, hardware organization of a system, running
a hello world program, cache memory, hierarchy of storage devices, how OS manages hardware,
etc
2. Representing and Manipulating information – information storage, integer representations, integer
arithmetic, floating point
3. Machine Level Representation of Programs – historical perspective, arithmetic and logical operations, control, etc
4. Optimizing Program Performance
5. Memory Hierarchy – cache memories
6. Linking
7. Dynamic Memory Allocation
8. C review as well as advanced topics in C
There is no guarantee all of these topics will be covered

Grading
Labs 15%
Quizzes 15%
Homework 10%
Participation 10%
Midterm (2) 40%
Final 10%
Grading
Performance in this course will be evaluated by labs, homeworks, class activities/participation, quizzes,
mid-term exams, and a final exam
These percentages are tentative. I reserve the right to adjust the percentages within each category by
up to 20%.
Grading Scale
90 – 100 A
80 – 89.999 B
70 – 79.999 C
60 – 69.999 D
Below 59.999 F
I will NOT curve grades. I may have 1 or 2 extra credit questions on each mid-term exam.
Letter grades will be based on a 10-point scale. (See Grading Scale Table)
I do NOT round up grades. This means 69.9999 is a D.
Labs
There will be at a minimal 10 labs this semester. Many of your labs will be programming labs. The
remaining labs will consist of practice of the material we are covering in class or material that is
designed to teach you a concept that will be helpful in future classes but not necessarily covered in
class. The programming labs will carry a higher weight than the remaining labs. Each lab instruction
