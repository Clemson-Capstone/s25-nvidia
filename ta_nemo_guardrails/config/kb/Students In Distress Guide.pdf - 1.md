someone in need of assistance. Faculty members, student advisers, coaches and 
staff are in a good position to identify someone who may be emotionally distressed. 
While some of the behaviors may be expected, especially during stressful times 
of the year, you might notice someone who is acting in a way that is unusual, 
out-of-character or uncharacteristic for them. Your ability to be empathetic and 
express interest and concern may be critical factors in helping an individual 
reestablish emotional equilibrium. Consult with the appropriate support areas and/
or contact the Office of Advocacy and Success by phone or review our website for 
resources. See area contacts in this document.
