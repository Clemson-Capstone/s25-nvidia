Attendance
Studies have found that the single most important factor that
contributes to success in a course is class attendance. With the
limited number of times this class meets, attendance is crucial to
your success in this class. Regular and punctual attendance at all
class sessions is required and expected. Roll will be taken daily. The
majority of the class sessions will consist of short lecture, discussion,
and presentations. When a student is presenting, everybody else will
be critiquing the presentation. If you arrive after a presentation has
begun, you will have to wait until the presenter is finished before
