documentation with an instructor. Based upon the circumstances, an instructor will decide an appropriate
course of action.
Projects: Four or five programming projects will be typically assigned during the semester. It is highly
recommended to start projects early since procrastinating on a project may result in a failing grade. Students
must submit their solutions using our course website and all projects are individual projects (no collaboration
is permitted). The project submissions must compile on our lab machines in order to receive credit (projects
that we cannot compile using will receive a grade of 0 ). Students are responsible for checking the correctness
of their programming projects before submitting them. After submitting a project, students should double
check that their submission was successful (to check this, download what you submitted, read over it, and
compile/run it in our lab machines to make sure that it is the correct version).
Except in the cases of serious illness or emergencies, projects must be submitted before the specified deadline
in order to receive credit. Projects not submitted before its specified deadline will receive a grade 0. Also,
projects submitted after its specified deadline (without instructor approval) will receive a grade of 0. Students
who have issues submitting their assignments should email their lab instructor before its deadline. Students
unable to submit a project due to a serious illness or other emergency should contact the instructor as soon as
possible before a projectâ€™s deadline. Based upon the circumstances, the instructor will decide an appropriate
course of action.
