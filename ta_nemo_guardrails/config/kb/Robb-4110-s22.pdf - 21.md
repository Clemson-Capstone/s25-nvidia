Academic advising (http://www.clemson.edu/academics/advising/index.html) is an ongoing educational
process that connects the student to the University. Academic advising supports the University's mission
of preparing the student for learning beyond the confines of the academy. Academic advisors represent
and interpret University policies and procedures to the student and help the student navigate the
academic and organizational paths of the institution.
Registrar
The Registrar's office (http://www.registrar.clemson.edu/html/indexStudents.htm) provides information
about important deadlines, degree and program requirements, and other key information, including use
