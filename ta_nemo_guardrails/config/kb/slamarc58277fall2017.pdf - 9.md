instructor) from your Clemson email account with a subject that contains “cpsc1060 regrade request for y”,
where y is the name of the assignment. If a rubric is posted for an assignment, then the regrade request
must include which parts of the grading rubric were incorrectly graded. Regrade requests may result in a
lower grade.
Electronic Devices: Students may not use personal electronic devices (including laptops, tablets, and

Email: Unfortunately, email communication does not scale to hundreds of students. Instead of emailing the
teaching staff with a general question, post that question on Piazza so other students can benefit from your
question, and other students can help you out. However, if students must email a member of the teaching
staff regarding another matter, then students must use their Clemson email accounts and put a [cpsc1060]
tag in the subject of their emails when corresponding with the instructor or TA on course-related matters.
Students should give the instructor and TAs 72 hours to respond to an email, and after 72 hours, the student
may resend the email or see the instructor (or TA) during office hours. Email communication should NOT
be treated as an alternative to meeting with the instructor (or TA) during office hours. Email will not be
used to provide private tutorials or to explain material that was covered in missed lectures. If an email
question cannot briefly be answered with a reply email, the instructor will indicate to the student that she
or he should see the instructor (or TA) during office hours. Instructors and TAs will not be able to debug
