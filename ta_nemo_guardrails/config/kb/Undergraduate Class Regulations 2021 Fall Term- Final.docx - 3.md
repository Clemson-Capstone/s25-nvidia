Policies on Incompletes and Medical WithdrawalsParagraph 45
Issuing an “Incomplete” grade (I) to a student is an option if a student is unable to complete make-up work in a timely manner due to illness or other issues. An Incomplete indicates that a relatively small part of the semester’s work remains undone. It is not intended for students who are failing a course otherwise. In the event that an Incomplete is appropriate, students will contact instructors in a timely manner so that instructors can provide a reasonable opportunity to complete remaining work. Instructors and students will work together to resolve the Incomplete grade as soon as possible, not to exceed thirty days from the first day of classes in the next scheduled session (excluding summer sessions and regardless of the student’s enrollment status).  More information on an Incomplete grade can be found in the Academic Regulations section of the Undergraduate Catalog.Paragraph 46
Sometimes due to illness (including COVID-19 related illness) or other life circumstances, students may not be able to complete academic work for the term and will need to withdraw from all classes. The Division of Undergraduate Studies will process medical withdrawals. Students should contact the Division by sending an email from their Clemson email address to Lisa Traynham at lltrayn@clemson.edu.Paragraph 48
