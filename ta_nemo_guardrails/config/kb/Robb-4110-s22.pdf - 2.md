This includes:
Getting the vaccine if you have the opportunity
Wearing a mask when you are indoors (and outdoors if distancing is impossible)

some of your fellow students), I greatly appreciate any measures you and I can take to keep them safe.
I would be happy to talk and listen to anyone who has questions or concerns about the vaccine and/or
recommended measures such as masking. Feel free to email me and we can set up a Zoom call outside
of office hours.
