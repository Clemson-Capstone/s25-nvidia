For each exam you are also required to do an environmental check for the monitoring system. You
must slowly show your entire desk area, the walls around your desk, and the floor around your desk.
You are required to have a completely clean desk with only one or two scraps of blank paper and one
or two pencils or pens. You are required to show both sides of the scrap paper during the environment
check. If you are using a laptop to take the exam and you have an external monitor you must turn the
monitor around. If you are using a desktop computer you may have only one monitor in use. Other
monitors must be turned off and turned around.
Canvas exams are prescheduled. If you are late starting you will not be given extra time to complete

and you do not take the final you will receive a 0 on the Final.
If you are sick and cannot take the final you must provide me with a written letter from a doctor
indicating you are too sick to take the final exam. An incomplete will be given, requiring you to take
