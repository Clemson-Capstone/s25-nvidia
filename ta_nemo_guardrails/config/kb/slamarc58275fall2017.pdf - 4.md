Labs: Starting on 09/04/17, labs will meet twice a week for 50 minutes. Students are required to attend
all scheduled labs for the lab section that they registered for, and students must arrive to their registered
lab section by the start of its period. Attendance is required and will be recorded during the first lab period
of the week. If students miss their first lab period of the week, then they will receive a grade of 0 on that
week’s lab assignment unless the absence is excused (excused absences are explained later in this section). If
students finish and submit the lab for the week, then they are not required to attend the second lab period
for that week. However, these students must show their lab instructor that the lab assignment has been
submitted correctly to be excused for the second lab section.
Lab assignments should be worked on during the allotted period and submitted to our course website for
grading. Students should not work on programming projects during lab time unless they have finished and
submitted the current week’s lab assignment. Lab assignments are due on the Friday of the week that
they are assigned before 5:00 pm unless otherwise stated by the lecture instructor. Whatever part of a lab
assignment is not finished during a student’s lab periods is considered homework.
All programs and files for a lab assignment must be submitted on our course website before its deadline.
Otherwise, a grade of 0 will be assigned. Students who have issues submitting their assignments should
email their lab instructor before its deadline. Submitted lab assignments must compile using a gcc compiler
on our Unix machines in order to receive credit (lab assignments that will not compile using a gcc compiler
on our Unix machines will receive a grade of 0 ).
