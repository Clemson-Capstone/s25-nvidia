one, or otherwise have access to one.
The recommended VR devices for this class are the original Oculus Quest and the Oculus Quest 2 (the
original Oculus Quest is no longer officially sold, however it can be purchased used on eBay). These are
recommended as they are both inexpensive and do not require a powerful PC to use. Other VR devices,
such as the Oculus Rift, the HTC Vive, or the Valve Index are also excellent choices, albeit more
expensive ones, and also require a powerful PC.
Required Software
Students are required to have access to the following software. All of this software is freely available for
Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux.
Zoom (https://zoom.us/) , for class meetings and office hours.
Clemson's Zoom resources can be found

Unity 2020.3 LTS (https://unity.com/products/unity-student) . Unity releases bug fixes every few
weeks. You do not need to update to the latest version when a new bug fix is released, though you
may if you want to.
You can register for a free Student account which will give you access to more advanced features
that will be useful for group projects
Unity can run on Linux, however, students have reported some difficulties when using a Linux
OS. I recommend installing Unity on a Windows or a Mac machine.
Available Resources
All students have access to Google Docs and other programs using their @g.clemson.edu email
address. This is a great tool for collaborative note-taking
All students have a Zoom account through Clemson. This is a great tool for you to meet with other
