observe you while taking the exam or quiz. 
You are also strongly encouraged to have a working set of 
headphones with a microphone for situations where privacy

extenuating circumstances with your instructor.
INTERNET CONNECTION
A reliable broadband internet connection is required for 
engaging in the virtual (online) portions of the class. If you do 
not have access to a reliable internet connection, please email 
ithelp@clemson.edu for assistance.
TECHNOLOGY RECOVERY
If the instructor has technical difficulties, students should use 
the available class time to review the lecture content and work 
on assignments. If the problems persist, the instructor will send 
an announcement with instructions for the missed material.
If you have technical difficulties joining the online session:
• Use the call-in number and participate via audio.
• Email both the instructor and TA for help, including a 
screenshot of the issue when possible.
ACADEMIC CONTINUITY PLAN
Clemson has developed an Academic Continuity Plan for 
academic operations. Should university administration officially 
determine that the physical classroom facility is not available to 
conduct classes, class will be conducted in a virtual (online) 
form. The university issues official disruption notifications 
through email, website, text notification and social media. 
When notified, use one of the following links to navigate to 
Clemson Canvas where you will find important information 
about how we will conduct class:
• Primary access link: http://www.clemson.edu/canvas
• Secondary access link, if needed:
https://clemson.instructure.com/
• You can also use the Canvas Student App. Visit the 
downloads page for this app. 
Course activities will occur through the Canvas course.
