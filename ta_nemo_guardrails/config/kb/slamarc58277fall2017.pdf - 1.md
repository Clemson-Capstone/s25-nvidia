eight hours per week outside of lectures and labs studying course concepts, practicing programming, and
working on labs and programming projects.
The course focuses on Java, an object-oriented programming language. Many lab assignments and programming projects will be assigned throughout the semester. Students will work on the projects and, if
needed, lab assignments outside of the normal class periods. This course will also introduce some basic Unix
commands and concepts.
Corequisites: Students enrolled in CPSC 1060 must also be enrolled in a section of CPSC 1061, which is
a zero credit hour lab.
Prerequisites or Concurrent Enrollment: Clemson Math Placement Test 60, which means you understand Precalculus concepts, or Undergraduate level CPSC 1040 Minimum Grade of D. Students with weak
backgrounds in mathematics may find it difficult to make a good grade in this course.
General Course Learning Objectives: By the end of the course, students should be able to:
1. Apply knowledge of compiling, running, testing, and debugging programs.
2. Design and implement algorithms to solve problems.
3. Write programs with a structured programming language that utilize variables, operators, expressions,
decision statements, loops, nested statements, arrays, methods, objects, classes, inputs, and/or outputs
to solve problems.
4. Write the output of a program by tracing through its source code.
5. Use an integrated development environment for programming.
6. Generate program documentation.
7. Use basic Unix commands.
