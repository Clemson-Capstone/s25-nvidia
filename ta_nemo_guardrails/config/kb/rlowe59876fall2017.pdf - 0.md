Objectives:
The objective in this class is for students to further develop their problem solving skills, develop proficiency 
in the C programming language, introduce the C++ programming language and introduce the implementation 
and use of standard data structures. 
By the end of this course you should: 
1. be proficient in using the C programming language,
2. be able to apply basic debugging and testing techniques,
3. understand what basic C++ code, including the use of classes, does,
4. be able to implement a program solution given a written problem definition,
5. understand basic data structures, their appropriate use and their implementation. 
Prerequisites:
The main prerequisite of this course is that you have had at least one introductory programming course 
using a standard programming language (C, C++, Java, Visual Basic, etc.). You should be comfortable with 
developing an algorithm to solve simple problems, and you should be able to comfortably implement the 
algorithm in some language. Clemson students who have taken CpSc 1110 and made a B or better should 
be adequately prepared for this class. 
In addition, students must score at least 36 on the preliminary exam.
