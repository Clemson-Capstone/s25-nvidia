Little did we all know that just a short time later, these plans would be tested with COVID-19.</p>
<p>Here is a quick list of things that may need to be considered in promoting the continuity of say a CPSC lab going online:</p>
<ul>
<li>Access to electronic versions of texts in case you aren't able to access McAdams or your dorm/apartment.</li>
<li>Files necessary for labs/classes should be consistently stored on Canvas or another Clemson approved cloud storage medium (such as <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://clemson.box.com" target="_blank">Clemson Box</a>).&nbsp;</li>
<li>Grades should ideally be stored on Canvas' gradebook and not locally on a hard drive</li>
<li>Internet considerations: if your home internet goes out in the middle of the lab, do you have a backup plan to connect back? &nbsp;For instance, some phones may allow being a temporary hotspot where you can at least connect to the Zoom or Teams call via audio.</li>
</ul>
<p>The purpose of this module is two-fold: first, we want to give you practice in creating and editing a short video. This may be an important part in continuity planning for your class/lab where you may need to construct a short video demonstrating a code snippet, introducing material, etc. &nbsp;Second, we want to use this module as an opportunity to give you feedback.</p>
