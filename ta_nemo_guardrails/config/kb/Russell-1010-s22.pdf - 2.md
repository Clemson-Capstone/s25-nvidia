ZOOM
We will use Zoom on an as-needed basis for lecture and lab 
sessions. The meeting times and links to the Zoom classroom 
are available through the Canvas course page.
COURSE DELIVERY FORMAT
This course will be delivered in-person for the Spring 2022
semester. This means that you will attend all lectures and labs 
in-person on Clemson’s main campus. 
For COVID-related contact tracing and mitigation efforts, it is 
important that you attend the lecture and lab sections you are 
registered for in iROAR. This ensures that the Clemson 
administration can deliver accurate, timely information relative 
to your course section should a positive COVID result be found 
within our classroom.
