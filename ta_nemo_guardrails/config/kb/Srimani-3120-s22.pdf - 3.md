University Accessibility Statement:
Clemson University values the diversity of our student body as a strength and a critical 
component of our dynamic community. Students with disabilities or temporary 
injuries/conditions may require accommodations due to barriers in the structure of 
facilities, course design, technology used for curricular purposes, or other campus 
resources. Students who experience a barrier to full access to this class should let the 
professor know, and make an appointment to meet with a staff member in Student 
Accessibility Services as soon as possible. You can make an appointment by calling 864-
656-6848, by emailing mailto:studentaccess@lists.clemson.edu, or by visiting Suite 239 
in the Academic Success Center building. Appointments are strongly encouraged – dropins will be seen if at all possible, but there could be a significant wait due to scheduled 
appointments. Students who receive Academic Access Letters are strongly encouraged to 
request, obtain and present these to their professors as early in the semester as possible so 
that accommodations can be made in a timely manner. It is the student’s responsibility to 
follow this process each semester. You can access further information here:
