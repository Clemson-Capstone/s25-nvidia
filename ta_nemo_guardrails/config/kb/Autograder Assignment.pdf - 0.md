CPSC 1900 – Teaching Assistant Fundamentals
To round out our autograder demo, let’s have you all submit some different possible student 
solutions! In the next module, we will go over why some of them work and some of them fail 
test cases. For this assignment, I will have some of you modify the code to work correctly, and 
some others will be assigned to change either the hello() function or addition() function and 
submit to the autograder. We will go through and show you the tests we are running and how 
to better setup the test cases with expected output.
