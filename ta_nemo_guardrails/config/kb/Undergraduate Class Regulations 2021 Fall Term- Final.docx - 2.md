Make-up Work Due to Missed AttendanceParagraph 37
Course instructors must implement fair grading procedures and provide an opportunity to make up missed assignments and examinations that does not unfairly penalize the student. Issuing specific dates by which make up work must be submitted without confirmation from the student could constitute unfair penalization, as students with illnesses or emergency may not always respond in a timely manner. Such make-up work shall be at the same level of difficulty with the missed assignment or examination. Course instructors shall hold all students to the same standard for making up missed assignments or examinations.Paragraph 38
While course instructors should seek to make reasonable accommodation for a student involved in University-sponsored activities, students should understand that not every course can accommodate absences and that absences do not lessen the need to meet all course objectives.Paragraph 40
Notification of AbsenceParagraph 41
The Notification of Absence link in Canvas allows students to quickly notify instructors of an absence from class and provides for the following categories: court attendance, death of family member, illness, illness of family member, injury, military duty, religious observance, scheduled surgery, university function, unscheduled hospitalization, other anticipated absence, or other unanticipated absence. The notification form requires a brief explanation, dates and times.  Based on the dates and times indicated, instructors are automatically selected, but students may decide which instructors will receive the notification. This does not serve as an “excuse” from class, and students are encouraged to discuss the absence with their instructors.Paragraph 42
