class; however, the labs may introduce some new material or may require you to apply the 
material in new ways. 
The labs are also designed for you to collaborate and get to know your classmates, so for 
many of the labs you will be working with a partner. Attendance in lab is REQUIRED. The 
lab attendance and participation grade shown in the table below is based on physical 
attendance during the lab session and contributions to the group design process.
While the labs are a small part of the overall class grade, you MUST pass your lab section to 
pass the course. 
GRADING INFORMATION
LETTER GRADES
Letter grades are assigned according to the standard 10% scale (A = 90-100%, B = 80-
89%, C = 70-79%, D = 60-69%, F = below 60%). Assignment point totals may be changed 
during the semester. Extra credit opportunities may arise throughout the semester; 
however, no extra credit opportunities will be offered after the last day of classes. 
Late work will not be accepted for credit. 
RE-GRADE REQUESTS
You may request a re-grade of any graded material. Email your request to the instructor, 
including detailed information about the original assignment and the reasons for your 
request. You must include your original submission (scanned in, if needed). 
Re-grade requests are due within one week after the instructor or lab TA returns the graded 
material, even if you are not in class. 
Please be aware that the course instructor will respond to all re-grade requests. The 
instructor will completely re-grade the assignment, and a re-grade request may result in a 
lower overall grade. Page 7
