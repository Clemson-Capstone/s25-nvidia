assignment is not finished during a student’s lab periods is considered homework.
All programs and files for a lab assignment must be submitted on our course website before its deadline.
Otherwise, a grade of 0 will be assigned. Students who have issues submitting their assignments should
email their lab instructor before its deadline. Submitted lab assignments must compile on our lab machines
in order to receive credit (lab assignments that we cannot compile will receive a grade of 0 ).
All lab assignments are individual assignments (no collaboration is permitted). Students are responsible
for checking the correctness of their lab assignments before submitting them, and students are responsible
for following all instructions stated in a lab assignment. After submitting an assignment, students should
double check that their online submission was successful, and that they submitted the correct version of
their assignment (to check this, download what you submitted, read over it, and compile/run it in our lab
machines to make sure that it is the correctly working version). Lab grading rubrics might be provided after
grades have been turned in for the lab. The rubrics will contain test cases not given in the lab assignment
itself; therefore, it is the student’s responsibility to come up with many additional test cases to ensure their
program is working correctly.
No makeup labs will be given. However, we understand that a lab may be missed due to a verified emergency
or severe illness. In the case of serious illness or emergencies, students must bring detailed documentation
(doctor’s note, etc.) about their serious illness or emergency to their lab instructor or lecture instructor
during office hours no more than 7 days after the lab was missed. The student must leave a copy of their
documentation with an instructor. Based upon the circumstances, an instructor will decide an appropriate
course of action.
