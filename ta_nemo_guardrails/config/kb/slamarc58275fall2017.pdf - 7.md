Students late to an exam may have points deducted from their exam grade. If you arrive late to any
exam after someone else has finished the exam, then you may not be permitted to take the exam, and
you may receive a zero on it. No restroom breaks allowed during an exam unless you’ve obtained a class
accommodation from the instructor before that exam begins. Students may be moved or assigned seats
during exams per the instructor’s discretion. Tentative dates for each exam are given below.
In-class Exam 1: September 29th, 2017 in our regularly scheduled lecture time and classroom
In-class Exam 2: November 3rd, 2017 in our regularly scheduled lecture time and classroom
Final Exam: December 11th, 2017, 8:00AM–10:30AM in our lecture classroom
Makeup exams will not be given. However, if exam 1 or exam 2 (not both) is missed due to an extreme
and verified emergency, then it might be excused by the instructor. To be considered for an excused exam
absence, students must bring detailed documentation explaining the circumstances to the instructor during
office hours no more than 7 days after an exam is missed. Student must leave a copy of their documentation
with the instructor. The instructor has full authority to decide whether or not to excuse an exam absence.
If the absence is excused, then the final exam score will be counted for the missed exam score (the missed
exam score will be scaled if the total points on the missed exam is different from the final exam). If the
absence is not excused, then a grade of 0 will be given. Only one exam may be excused. If two or more
exams are missed, then a grade of 0 will be recorded for all missed exams. Exams will not be handed back
to students to look over during class or to keep. However, students may briefly view their graded exam 1 or
exam 2 during the lecture instructor’s office hours within two weeks after their exam grade is posted. Exams
