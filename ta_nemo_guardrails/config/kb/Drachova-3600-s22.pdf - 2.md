Course Delivery Mode
This is a traditional classroom course taught on main CU campus at the time and location 
stated in the syllabus and CU schedule of classes. There is no longer an online attendance 
option for this course. Lectures will not be recorded. 
Course Components
 Lectures
Lectures will be held on Tuesdays and Thursdays and will cover chapters of the required 
textbook and other materials. Textbook readings and papers will be assigned during 
lecture periods, and students should keep up with these readings throughout the 
semester. 
Some lectures may be held virtually, in the case of instructor exposure, quarantine, illness,
or etc, and in such a case they will be announced in advance. Lectures will not cover all 
the necessary material, such as slides and chapters, and students will be responsible for 
covering them on their own. Students are expected to take notes and participate in the 
classroom discussions regularly. Respectful exchange of opinions and ideas is 
encouraged in the class, as much can be learned from a variety of perspectives different 
individuals have on the subject. 
Quizzes
Throughout the semester, there will be a variable number of announced and unannounced
online and paper graded quizzes. Some quizzes will be open-book quizzes. You should 
always expect a pop-up quiz! The total number of points a student can earn on the 
quizzes by the end of the semester is 120. Missed quizzes cannot be made up, except in 
cases of a documented illness, or a documented emergency (See Late Work policy 
below).
Assignments
â€¢ Students will be assigned four programming assignments (HW 1, 2, 3) during 
the semester.
