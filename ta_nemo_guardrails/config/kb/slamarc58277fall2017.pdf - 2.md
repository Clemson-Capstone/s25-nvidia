Recommended Texts:
1. Paul Deitel & Harvey Deitel. Java How To Program (late objects) (10th Edition). This book is not

participate regularly. Attendance is required and will be recorded. Students should arrive to lectures by
the start of the period and be in the class for the duration of the period unless otherwise stated by the
instructor. An unexcused absence will be recorded for students who miss a lecture attendance check. Failure
to bring your TigerOne Id card to an attendance check will also result in an unexcused absence. Also, if
your TigerOne Id card cannot be scanned, then that will count as an unexcused absence.
Quizzes: Throughout the semester, quizzes will take place during lecture periods. Quizzes will be unannounced and graded, and except in cases of serious illness or emergencies, quizzes cannot be made up.
Students must take each quiz during the lecture period it is assigned in order to receive credit. In the case
