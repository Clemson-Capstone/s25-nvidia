Medical Withdrawal
Sometimes due to illness or other life circumstances, students may not be able to complete 
academic work for the term and will need to withdraw from all classes. The Division of 
Undergraduate Studies will process medical withdrawals. Students should contact the 
Division by sending an email from their Clemson email address to Lisa Traynham at 
lltrayn@clemson.edu

Technical Issues
Every student is responsible for maintaining their computer equipment in working order and 
free of malware. Every student also needs to have a contingency plan in case of equipment 
failure. Always have a plan A, and a plan B! Two is one, and one is none! If a student waits 
until the last day to complete their assignment, and experiences technical difficulties, such 
student will not be granted any extensions. Planning is a key to timely completion of assigned
work. Allowing student to make up the missed work will be at the discretion of the course 
instructor after the documentation has been reviewed. 
Grade Calculation
Students must be registered for this course in order to attend class and to receive any 
grades. Students who are auditing this course may not receive graded feedback. Student 
grade will be based on the total number of points that the student earned during the semester.
Distribution of points is shown below. 
Approximate weight of each component is provided to simply indicate the portion of each 
component in the student’s course grade. No multiplication is necessary to calculate the 
course grade. All weights have been worked into the point value of the components. To 
determine student’s grade in the course, total points earned by that student will be divided by 
600 (after the final exam), or 500 (in case of the final exam exemption). 
Please note that there is NO attendance component in the course grade. 
Please also note that Canvas does not automatically account for all kinds of extra credit.
