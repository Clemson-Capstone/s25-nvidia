indicated by the University testing results, this will be considered an excused absence. 
Additional communication via email is encouraged; students should follow up with their 
instructor to develop a continued plan of study for each course.

University power outage, etc. will be given at the next class meeting unless contacted by the 
instructor. Any assignments due at the time of a class cancellation due to inclement weather will
