HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENTS
Homework assignments are completed individually online in the Programming in C zyBook. 
These assignments consist of longer and more complex coding activities that are designed 
to provide practice with specific coding concepts introduced in the reading and lecture.
EXAMS
All exams and quizzes are closed book. This means that you ARE NOT allowed to use your 
textbook, notes, internet, or any other resource (including classmates) during the exam 
unless otherwise indicated by the instructor at the time of the assessment. 
Detailed written instructions will be provided on Canvas for every exam.
Students may request to take an exam earlier than the scheduled exam date. This request 
must be made in writing (via email) at least one week prior to the scheduled exam date. 
Only under exceptional circumstances, such as family or medical emergencies, will a 
student who did not make such a request and was not in attendance on the exam date be 
allowed to take a revised version makeup exam at a different time. Final exam conflicts 
must be resolved by the mid-semester point. Page 6
