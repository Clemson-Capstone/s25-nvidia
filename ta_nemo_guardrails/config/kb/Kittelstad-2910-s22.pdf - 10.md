highest credit you can receive for participation is 10 points; if you
miss 3 classes, the most points you can receive is 5; 4 or more
missed classes will result in a 0 for this portion of your grade.
Each student will fill out a critique for each presentation using Google
forms. If you are late to class, DO NOT walk in while the presenter is
in the middle of his/her presentation!! Wait until that person finishes
and then come on in. And, DO NOT fill out a critique for the
presentation for which you were not present in class!!! Missed
critiques will count as absences for that day.
You are expected to complete the critiques conscientiously and
constructively. The presenterâ€™s critiques will be provided to him/her
within a week or two of his/her presentation (minus the names of
those who filled out the critique). They are meant to provide good
feedback for the presenter to be used for future improvement. If any
of the critiques appear to be not taken seriously, then a zero may be
given for that critique.

first come first serve basis. If my office
hours do not work for you, you can make
an appointment to meet with me at
another time that works for both of us.
Please do not make an appointment
unless you cannot attend office hours due
to a conflict with your class or work
schedule. Due to the number of students I
have each semester, I cannot meet with
everyone individually.
Also, when you come to my office for
help, please have specific questions
prepared. Office hours or meetings with
me are not a time for you to work on the

and given the delays that can occur with
emails that exchange can take quite some
time, leaving you less time to complete
your assignment.
Additionally, if you want something to be
a priority for me, make sure it is a
