on our Unix machines in order to receive credit (lab assignments that will not compile using a gcc compiler
on our Unix machines will receive a grade of 0 ).
All lab assignments are individual assignments (no collaboration is permitted). Students are responsible
for checking the correctness of their lab assignments before submitting them, and students are responsible
for following all instructions stated in a lab assignment. After submitting an assignment, students should
double check that their online submission was successful, and that they submitted the correct version of
their assignment (to check this, download what you submitted, read over it, and compile/run it in our Unix
machines to make sure that it is the correctly working version). Lab grading rubrics might be provided after
grades have been turned in for the lab. The rubrics will contain test cases not given in the lab assignment
itself; therefore, it is the student’s responsibility to come up with many additional test cases to ensure their
program is working correctly.
No makeup labs will be given. However, we understand that a lab may be missed due to a verified emergency
or severe illness. In the case of serious illness or emergencies, students must bring detailed documentation
(doctor’s note, etc.) about their serious illness or emergency to their lab instructor or lecture instructor
during office hours no more than 7 days after the lab was missed. The student must leave a copy of their
documentation with an instructor. Based upon the circumstances, an instructor will decide an appropriate
course of action.
Projects: Four programming projects will be typically assigned during the semester. It is highly recommended to start projects early since procrastinating on a project may result in a failing grade. Students must
submit their solutions using our course website and all projects are individual projects (no collaboration is
