Course Overview 
This course reviews different aspects of Autonomous Vehicles (AV) Technology in the intersection of 
perception, autonomous control, and networking, . Specific potential topics include introduction to 
unmanned ground and aerial vehicles, principles of autonomy, computer vision for autonomous 
vehicles, video stabilization, perspective projection, video-based object detection and tracking, 
Lidars and distance sensors, point clouds, search-based and learning-based path planning, basics of 
v2v and v2x communications, driving safety, traffic flow, and mobile edge computing. 
This course is particularly suitable for senior-level undergraduate and graduate students who are 
interested in or involved with research in unmanned aerial and ground vehicles (UAV/UGV) or 
closely related areas. It is well suited for students who have reasonably solid backgrounds on 
machine learning, pattern recognition, artificial intelligence, and are familiar with the basics of 
networking and unmanned vehicles. However, we will review necessary material in the beginning of 
each topic, to make the course usable by students from different disciplines such as CS, EE, CE, ME.Page 2
