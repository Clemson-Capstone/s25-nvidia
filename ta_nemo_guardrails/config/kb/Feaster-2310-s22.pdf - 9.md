If you have a question please raise your hand. I welcome questions and comments during lecture, all I
ask is you be respectful to me and your classmates.
Disability Access
Clemson University values the diversity of our student body as a strength and a critical component
of our dynamic community. Students with disabilities or temporary injuries/conditions may require
accommodations due to barriers in the structure of facilities, course design, technology used for curricular purposes, or other campus resources.Students who experience a barrier to full access to a class
should let the professor know, and make an appointment to meet with a staff member in Student
Accessibility Services as soon as possible.You can make an appointment by calling 864-656-6848or by
emailing studentaccess@lists.clemson.edu. Students who receive Academic Access Letters are strongly
encouraged to request, obtain and present these to their professors as early in the semester as possible
so that accommodations can be made in a timely manner.It is the student’s responsibility to follow
this process each semester.You can access further information here: http://www.clemson.edu/campuslife/campus-services/sds/.
