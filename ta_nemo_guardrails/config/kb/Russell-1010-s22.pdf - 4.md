TIPS FOR WORKING WITH 
A PARTNER OR GROUP
We will be working in pairs and 
groups a lot this semester. It is 
likely that you will be paired 
with different students every 
week in lecture or lab, so you 
will have the opportunity to 
meet several of your 
classmates in the coming 
weeks. This is a fun way to get 
to know your cohort!
1. Take a couple of mins for 
introductions - be yourself! 
2. Exchange contact info.
3. Talk about the assignment 
details and make an agreement 
- what is it, when is it due, etc.
4. Dive in and get going! Page 4

COMMUNICATION
It is your responsibility to check Canvas and your Clemson 
email at least twice a day. 
All emails to instructors and TAs must come from your Clemson 
email address. Please allow 24 hours for the instructor and TAs 
to respond to your email on weekdays, and 48 hours on 
weekends/breaks. 
Neither the instructor or the TA will correspond with your 
parents or guardians about your grades. 
ATTENDANCE POLICY
Attendance during lectures and lab sessions is mandatory 
unless explicitly excused by the instructor. Attendance may be 
taken randomly in class and in lab. If you miss a class, check 
the announcements in Canvas and reach out to your 
classmates about important material. 
You do not need to notify the instructor in advance of a planned 
absence, except in cases of extreme or emergency 
circumstances that will result in your missing more than one 
week of classes. Excessive missed classes will impact your final
