is recommended for students who would like more examples than provided in our required course
textbook.
Lectures: Lectures will be typically held three times a week for 50 minutes and will cover several chapters
of the required course textbook and other materials. Textbook and online readings will be assigned during
lecture periods, and students should keep up with these readings throughout the semester. Students are
required to bring their TigerOne Id card to all lectures, and students are expected to take notes and
participate regularly. Attendance is required and will be recorded. Students should arrive to lectures by
the start of the period and be in the class for the duration of the period unless otherwise stated by the
instructor. An unexcused absence will be recorded for students who miss a lecture attendance check. Failure
to bring your TigerOne Id card to an attendance check will also result in an unexcused absence. Also, if
your TigerOne Id card cannot be scanned, then that will count as an unexcused absence.
Quizzes: Throughout the semester, quizzes will take place during lecture periods. Quizzes will be unannounced and graded, and except in cases of serious illness or emergencies, quizzes cannot be made up.
Students must take each quiz during the lecture period it is assigned in order to receive credit. In the case
of serious illness or emergencies, students must bring detailed documentation about their serious illness or
emergency to the instructor during office hours no more than 7 days after the quiz was missed. The student
must leave a copy of their documentation with the instructor. Based upon the circumstances, the instructor
will decide an appropriate course of action (typically, the missed quiz grade will be replaced by the average
of some other quiz grades).
Course Website: We will use a Clemson Canvas course website for CPSC 1010 and CPSC 1011 accessible
