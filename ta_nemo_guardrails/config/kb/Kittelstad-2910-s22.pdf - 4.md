Being absent, excused or not, does not change the responsibility for
assigned work or material covered during the class. For Universitysponsored events, students must provide written notice prior to the
event. For all other excused absences, students should provide to the
instructor as soon as possible, written documentation from an
acceptable outside source (e.g., school administrator or physician).
All quizzes/tests/exams will be out of class and on-line. No make-up
quizzes or exams will be given.
If I am more than ten (10) minutes late, you should assume that I
am dealing with an emergency and will not make it to class. Check
your email in those circumstances for further explanation.
In the event the university should cancel classes, inclement weather,
power outage, etc., any exam that was scheduled will be given at the
next class meeting unless contacted by the instructor. Any
assignments due at the time of the class cancellation not
electronically submitted will be due at the next class meeting unless
contacted by the instructor. Students will be notified of extension or
postponement of assignments or exams by email and by an
announcement on Canvas.
