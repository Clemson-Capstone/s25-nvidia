Course Website: We will use a Clemson Canvas course website for CPSC 1060 and CPSC 1061 accessible
from https://www.clemson.edu/canvas, which will henceforth be called the course website. Students will
submit assignments and grades will be posted to that site. Helpful course materials such as instructional
material, lab and project assignments, course schedule, TA office hours, and links will be posted on the course
website. Students are responsible for checking the course website daily for new information or announcements.
Topical Outline and Course Assignments:
The topical (and tentative) outline for this course including assignments and their due dates can be found
on our course website.
Piazza: All students must enroll in the CPSC 1060 course on www.piazza.com, which will be available
after the drop/add period of registration ends. You will receive a confirmation email to your Clemson
email account before the end of the second week of the semester. If you have any questions on how to
enroll, then please see your instructor. This website will be used for course discussions, announcements,
and Q & A. Piazza announcements made by the instructor or a lab instructor are considered official course
announcements. If you have a question about anything pertaining to course materials or assignments, then
please post the question to Piazza before emailing the teaching staff. Typically, many students have the
same questions and others will benefit from seeing the Q & A on Piazza. You are NOT allowed to post
any code or solutions to lab/programming assignments on Piazza. This is used only for general Q & A. Do
