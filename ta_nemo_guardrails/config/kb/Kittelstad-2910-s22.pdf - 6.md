Title IX Coordinator, and the Executive
Director of Equity Compliance. Her

Class Environment and
Conduct
I expect to foster a nurturing learning
environment based on communication
and mutual respect. I expect to have
adults in class who will conduct
themselves with professionalism and
courtesy at all times, showing not only
respect for others, but also by being
willing to hear new ideas.
Students are expected to be courteous and
respectful in all interactions with fellow
class members, TAs, and the instructor,
whether this interaction occurs online,
during class, or outside of class. Student
misconduct will not be tolerated. Student
misconduct includes but is not limited to
whispering or talking during lecture,Page 4

Clemson degree. Therefore, we shall not tolerate lying, cheating, or
stealing in any form.”
Academic integrity is taken very seriously. The University’s Academic
Integrity Policy is here. Unless otherwise instructed, you are
expected to work independently on projects and labs. The instructor
may use automated tools to determine plagiarism. Instances of
copying or sharing, or cheating in any way will result in an academic
dishonesty charge, which can lead to an F in the course or expulsion
from the university. Each student is responsible for protecting his or
her files and work from access by others. Work that is essentially the
same and submitted without proper attribution is considered to be a
violation of academic dishonesty policies by all those submitting the
work, regardless of who actually did the work.
