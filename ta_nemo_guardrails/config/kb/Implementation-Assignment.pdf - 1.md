CPSC 1900 – Assignment 2
Submission: 
• Zip your autograder files and folders with the name Autograder‐<lastname>.zip,
replacing the <lastname> with your last name.
• Submit your zip file to the correct Canvas assignment by the deadline.
Helpful Notes: 
• The autograder video and documentation linked on Canvas will help you get started 
and show you more in-depth how to set up the autograder, run it, and write test cases.
• Test your autograder incrementally using the two student submissions attached to the 
assignment. Student 1’s submission should fail the magic squares test cases (think 
about why that’s the case, there’s a few reasons), and Student 2’s submission should 
pass all test cases. 
• If you need help or have questions, feel free to ask in the Teams channel for this class
or the Autograder Help channel
