a prohibition against sexual harassment and sexual violence as mandated by Title IX of the 
Education Amendments of 1972. 
The University is committed to combatting sexual harassment and sexual violence. As a 
result, you should know that University faculty and staff members who work directly with 
students are required to report any instances of sexual harassment and sexual violence, to 
the University’s Title IX Coordinator. What this means is that as your professor, I am required 
to report any incidents of sexual harassment, sexual violence or misconduct, stalking, 
domestic and/or relationship violence that are directly reported to me, or of which I am 
somehow made aware. 
There are two important exceptions to this requirement about which you should be aware:
• Confidential Resources and facilitators of sexual awareness programs such as "Take 
Back the Night and Aspire to be Well" when acting in those capacities, are not required
to report incidents of sexual discrimination.
• Another important exception to the reporting requirement exists for academic work. 
Disclosures about sexual harassment, sexual violence, stalking, domestic and/or 
relationship violence that are shared as part of an academic project, a research 
project, classroom discussion, or course assignment, are not required to be disclosed 
to the University’s Title IX Coordinator. This policy is located at
