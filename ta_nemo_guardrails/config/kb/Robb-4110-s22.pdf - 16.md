Assignments and Class Cancellation:
Any assignments due in class at the time of a class cancellation will be due at the next class meeting

must be granted by the instructor via email or Canvas within 24 hours.
Honor Code & Collaboration:
Students are encouraged to discuss course concepts and programming questions with each other (both

must include attribution.

Instructor Late to Class:

wait 15 minutes after the class was scheduled to start before leaving.

appropriate, students will contact instructors in a timely manner so that instructors can provide a
