The University is committed to combatting sexual harassment and sexual violence. As a 
result, you should know that University faculty and staff members who work directly with 
students are required to report any instances of sexual harassment and sexual violence, to 
the University’s Title IX Coordinator. What this means is that as your professor, I am 
required to report any incidents of sexual harassment, sexual violence or misconduct, 
stalking, domestic and/or relationship violence that are directly reported to me, or of which I 
am somehow made aware. There are two important exceptions to this requirement about 
which you should be aware:
1. Confidential Resources and facilitators of sexual awareness programs such as 
"Take Back the Night and Aspire to be Well" when acting in those capacities, are 
not required to report incidents of sexual discrimination.
2. Another important exception to the reporting requirement exists for academic 
work. Disclosures about sexual harassment, sexual violence, stalking, domestic 
and/or relationship violence that are shared as part of an academic project, a 
research project, classroom discussion, or course assignment, are not required to 
be disclosed to the University’s Title IX Coordinator.
