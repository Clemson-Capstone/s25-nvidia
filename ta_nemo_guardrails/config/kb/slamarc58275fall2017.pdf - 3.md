Course Website: We will use a Clemson Canvas course website for CPSC 1010 and CPSC 1011 accessible
from https://www.clemson.edu/canvas, which will henceforth be called the course website. Students will
submit assignments and grades will be posted to that site. Helpful course materials such as instructional
material, lab and project assignments, course schedule, TA office hours, and links will be posted on the course
website. Students are responsible for checking the course website daily for new information or announcements.

The topical (and tentative) outline for this course including assignments and their due dates can be found

Piazza: All students must enroll in the CPSC 1010 course on www.piazza.com, which will be available
after the drop/add period of registration ends. You will receive a confirmation email to your Clemson
email account before the end of the second week of the semester. If you have any questions on how to
enroll, then please see your instructor. This website will be used for course discussions, announcements,
