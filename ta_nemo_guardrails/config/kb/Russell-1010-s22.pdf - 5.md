ACADEMIC INTEGRITY STATEMENT
As members of the Clemson University community, we have 
inherited Thomas Green Clemson's vision of this institution as a 
"high seminary of learning." Fundamental to this vision is a 
mutual commitment to truthfulness, honor, and responsibility, 
without which we cannot earn the trust and respect of others. 
Furthermore, we recognize that academic dishonesty detracts 
from the value of a Clemson degree. Therefore, we shall not 
tolerate lying, cheating, or stealing in any form. 
All infractions of academic dishonesty by undergraduates must 
be reported to Undergraduate Studies for resolution through 
that office. In cases of plagiarism instructors may use the 
Plagiarism Resolution Form.
See the Undergraduate Academic Integrity Policy website for 
additional information and the current catalogue for the policy. 
STRATEGIES FOR SUCCESS
Intro courses can be hard, so 
you will need to develop some 
strategies to get you through.
TIP #1: Read. A lot. 
Reading the textbook once isn’t 
enough. You will need to read 
the material time and again to 
really anchor it in.
TIP #2: Find a battle buddy.
Don’t try to get through this 
course alone. Find someone (or 
several someones) that you 
can turn to if you get stuck or 
need to vent.
TIP #3: Don’t get behind. 
We will move at a very fast 
pace this semester. Getting 
behind can be disastrous.
TIP #4: Talk out loud about 
what you are learning.
