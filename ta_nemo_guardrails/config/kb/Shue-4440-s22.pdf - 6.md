Student Accessibility Services
Clemson University values the diversity of our student body as a strength and a critical component of our
dynamic community. Students with disabilities or temporary injuries/conditions may require
accommodations due to barriers in the structure of facilities, course design, technology used for
curricular purposes, or other campus resources. Students who experience a barrier to full access to this
class should let the instructor know and make an appointment to meet with a staff member in Student
Accessibility Services as soon as possible. You can make an appointment by calling 864-656-6848, by
emailing studentaccess@lists.clemson.edu, (mailto:studentaccess@lists.clemson.edu) or by visiting
Suite 239 in the Academic Success Center building. Appointments are strongly encouraged – drop-ins
will be seen, if at all possible, but there could be a significant wait due to scheduled appointments.
Students who have accommodations are strongly encouraged to request, obtain, and send these
(https://www.clemson.edu/academics/studentaccess/register.html) to their instructors via SAS as early in
the semester as possible so that accommodations can be made in a timely manner. It is the student’s
responsibility to follow this process each semester.
