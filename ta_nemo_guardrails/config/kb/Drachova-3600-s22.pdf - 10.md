Class Accommodation and Accessibility
Clemson University values the diversity of our student body as a strength and a critical 
component of our dynamic community. Students with disabilities or temporary 
injuries/conditions may require accommodations due to barriers in the structure of facilities, 
course design, technology used for curricular purposes, or other campus resources. Students
who experience a barrier to full access to a class should let the professor know, and make an 
appointment to meet with a staff member in Student Accessibility Services as soon as 
possible.
You can make an appointment by calling 864-656-6848, by emailing 
studentaccess@lists.clemson.edu, or by visiting Suite 239 in the Academic Success Center 
building. Appointments are strongly encouraged – drop-ins will be seen if possible, but there 
could be a significant wait due to scheduled appointments. Students who receive Academic 
Access Letters are strongly encouraged to request, obtain and present these to their 
professors as early in the semester as possible so that accommodations can be made in a 
timely manner.
It is the student’s responsibility to follow this process each semester. You can access further 
information here: http://www.clemson.edu/campus-life/campus-services/sds/.
If You Need Help
Your teacher is here to help you learn the material. To get help you have several options. 
1. Talk to your teacher, many times a brief discussion will clarify things enough to get you 
back on track.
2. Get an additional textbook/materials to help practice programming concepts outside of 
class.
3. Use search engine to get clarification or another perspective on a difficult concept.
