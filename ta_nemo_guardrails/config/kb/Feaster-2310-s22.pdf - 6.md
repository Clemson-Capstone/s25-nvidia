single class can make it difficult to keep up with the course material. Regular and punctual attendance
at all class sessions is expected.
I will take attendance each class, using the School of Computings checkin system. The SOC checkin

and ready to sign in to the checkin system, I will not allow attendance through email nor verbally.
Being absent does not change the responsibility for assigned work or material covered during the class.
It is up to you to attend regularly. If you miss a class it is your responsibility to get the notes,
assignments, etc from a classmate. I will post the slides each day.

will not make it to class. Check your email in those circumstances for further explanation.
In the event the university should cancel classes, inclement weather, power outage, etc., any exam that
was scheduled will be given at the next class meeting unless contacted by me. Students will be notified
of extension or postponement of assignments or exams through Canvas.

incorrectly. In other words, make your case. It is not enough to say I thought this was the answer
or could you look at this question again. You should understand a regrade request will result in the
