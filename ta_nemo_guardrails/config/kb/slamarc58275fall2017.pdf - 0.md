Course Catalog Description:
Introduction to modern problem solving and programming methods. Special emphasis is placed on algorithm
development and software life cycle concepts. Includes use of appropriate tools and discusses ethical issues
involving computing and society. Credit will only be given for one of CPSC 1010, 1060 or 1110.
Extended Description:
This course is a rigorous introduction to problem solving using fundamental programming techniques: variables, operators, expressions, inputs, outputs, loops, decision statements, arrays, strings, functions, pointers,
and structures. This course includes labs and programming projects incorporating algorithm design and
implementation with a structured programming language, and hands-on experience creating, testing, and
debugging software in a Unix environment. This course is typically taken by computer science majors, technical majors, or anyone highly motivated and interested in learning how to program. Students are expected
to spend, on average, six to eight hours per week outside of lectures and labs studying course concepts,
