Clemson University values the diversity of our student body as a strength and a critical component of our
dynamic community. Students with disabilities or temporary injuries/conditions may require
accommodations due to barriers in the structure of facilities, course design, technology used for
curricular purposes, or other campus resources. Students who experience a barrier to full access to this
class should let the professor know, and make an appointment to meet with a staff member in Student
Accessibility Services as soon as possible. You can make an appointment by calling 864-656-6848, by
emailing studentaccess@lists.clemson.edu (mailto:studentaccess@lists.clemson.edu) , or by visiting
Suite 239 in the Academic Success Center building. Appointments are strongly encouraged – drop-ins
will be seen if at all possible, but there could be a significant wait due to scheduled appointments.
Students who receive Academic Access Letters are strongly encouraged to request, obtain, and present
these to their professors as early in the semester as possible so that accommodations can be made in a
timely manner. It is the student’s responsibility to follow this process each semester. You can access
further information at the Student Accessibility Services Website
(http://www.clemson.edu/academics/studentaccess/) and the Office of Access and Equity Website
