COURSE TECHNOLOGIES
CLEMSON CANVAS
We will use Canvas (http://www.clemson.edu/canvas/) for all 
course announcements, assignments, and exams. There will be 
a weekly announcement outlining the assignments and 
readings due that week. The course schedule will be conveyed 
via Canvas. 
ZYBOOKS
We will use our course zyBook and the zyBook integrated 
development environment (IDE), for all reading-related 
homework, in-class coding activities, and lab assignments.
Although we will practice and become familiar with other 
environments, IDEs, and tools, all graded coding assignments
will be completed in zyBooks.
ZOOM
We will use Zoom on an as-needed basis for lecture and lab 
sessions. The meeting times and links to the Zoom classroom 
are available through the Canvas course page.
