Email Communication
Email communication should be from
your official Clemson email account. I
have over 200 students each semester, so
you will need to remember to include in
your email which section of which class
you are in. While I try to answer emails
fairly quickly, the standard is to allow 24
hours during the week and 48 hours on
weekends/breaks before emailing me
again. When inundated with emails, I
triage them, responding to the emails that
require a quick response. If you feel your
email was important but did not receive a
response within 24-48 hours, do not be
afraid to gently remind me that you are
waiting for a response. Keep in mind that
when I receive the same question from
several students, I send a blanket
response to the class, so it could be that
your response was included in that email.
Canvas offers a messaging system
which is NOT an effective way to reach
me. Due to the lack of notifications, it
can take days for me to respond to a
message on Canvas. Lastly, due to
federal rules, without written permission,
I will not correspond with a student's
parent or guardian.Page 2
