Participation
I will expect you to participate actively during the class. Participation is for the duration of the class
or until you have been excused by the instructor.
Submission of Work
Each assignment will list due dates and delivery instructions. Work should be submitted via the 
submission program specified for each assignment. You may not use email to submit any work 
unless the submission program is not operational. In that case, please email your course instructor 
(by the assignment deadline) and include 1) a screenshot of the malfunction of the submission 
system and 2) your work. You are responsible for ensuring that your work was submitted correctly 
via the submission utility. Grades will be available through Canvas. 
Assignment late policy
Students should speak with their course instructors regarding any scheduled absence as soon 
as possible and develop a plan for any make-up work. In the event of an emergency, the 
student should make direct contact with the course instructor, preferably before a class or an 
exam/quiz takes place. It is the studentâ€™s responsibility to secure documentation of 
emergencies, if required. 
Re-Grade Requests
A student may request a regrade of an assignment within 7 days of the assignment feedback 
being returned or posted, regardless of whether a student is present in class. For a re-grade 
request, a student should email their course instructor with a detailed justification for the re-grade.
