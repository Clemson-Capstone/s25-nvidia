to spend, on average, six to eight hours per week outside of lectures and labs studying course concepts,
practicing programming, and working on labs and programming projects.
The course focuses on C, a popular programming language. Several lab assignments and programming
projects will be assigned throughout the semester. Students will work on the projects and, if needed, lab
assignments outside of the normal class and lab periods. This course will also introduce some basic Unix
commands and concepts.
Corequisites: Students enrolled in CPSC 1010 must also be enrolled in a section of CPSC 1011, which is
a zero credit hour lab.
Prerequisites or Concurrent Enrollment: Clemson Math Placement Test 60, which means you understand Precalculus concepts, or Undergraduate level CPSC 1040 Minimum Grade of D. Students with weak
backgrounds in mathematics may find it difficult to make a good grade in this course.
General Course Learning Objectives: By the end of the course, students should be able to:
1. Apply knowledge of compiling, running, testing, and debugging C programs in an Unix environment.
2. Use basic Unix commands.
3. Design and implement algorithms to solve problems.
4. Write programs in C that utilize variables, operators, expressions, inputs, outputs, loops, decision
statements, arrays, strings, functions, pointers, and/or structures to solve problems.
5. Write the output of a program by tracing through its source code.
6. Use good programming style and standards.
