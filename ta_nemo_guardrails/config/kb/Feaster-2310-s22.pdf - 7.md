or could you look at this question again. You should understand a regrade request will result in the
entire assignment being regraded, which could result in a lower grade than the original grade. This
policy is not designed as a punishment, only that sometimes in addition to grading something incorrect
that you actually did get correct, we may have incorrectly given credit for something that was actually
incorrect and may be caught during the regrade. After one week, under no circumstances will
I consider a regrade nor change a grade.
Academic Integrity
“As members of the Clemson University community, we have inherited Thomas Green Clemson’s vision of this institution as a ‘high seminary of learning.’ Fundamental to this vision is
a mutual commitment to truthfulness, honor, and responsibility, without which we cannot
earn the trust and respect of others. Furthermore, we recognize that academic dishonesty
detracts from the value of a Clemson degree. Therefore, we shall not tolerate lying, cheating,
or stealing in any form.”
Academic integrity is taken very seriously. The University’s statement on academic integrity can be
found at www.clemson.edu/administration/student-affairs/student-handbook/universitypolicies/
academic_integrity.html. Unless otherwise instructed, you are expected to work independently on
homeworks, programming projects, labs, and another assigned work. I may use automated tools to look
for similarities in code which could indicate plagiarism. Instances of copying or sharing, or cheating in
any way will result in an academic dishonesty charge, which can lead to an F in the course or expulsion
from the university. Each student is responsible for protecting his or her files and work from access
by others. Work that is essentially the same and submitted without proper attribution is considered
to be a violation of academic dishonesty policies by all those submitting the work, regardless of who
actually did the work.
