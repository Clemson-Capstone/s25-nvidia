via email. Students must bring documentation about an absence to an instructor or TA during office hours
within 7 days after an absence occurred.
Conduct Policy: Students are expected to be courteous and respectful in all interactions with fellow class
members, TAs, and the instructor (whether this interaction occurs online, during class, or outside of class).
Student misconduct will not be tolerated. Student misconduct includes, but not limited to, arguing with
an instructor or TA about course policies, being rude or disrespectful towards a fellow class member or
an instructor, sleeping in class, disrupting class, using a computer or other device during class without
authorization from the instructor, showing up to class late or leaving class early without permission from
the instructor, and refusing to follow course policies or instructions stated by an instructor. The instructor
and TAs have the right to assign seats or to ask students to move to another seat if they feel it is necessary,
and refusing to sit in an assigned seat will also be considered as an act of student misconduct. Also, no
tobacco products or electronic cigarettes are allowed to be used during class or labs, and these prohibited
things include (but not limited to) cigarettes, cigars, chewing tobacco, dip, snuff, etc. For the first case of
student misconduct, students may have points deducted from their Quiz grades or their final grade might be
lowered by one full letter grade (i.e. an A becomes a B, B becomes a C, etc.) at the instructor’s discretion.
In extreme cases, or if the misconduct persists, a grade of F will be assigned to the student, and the student
will not be allowed to attend class thereafter.
