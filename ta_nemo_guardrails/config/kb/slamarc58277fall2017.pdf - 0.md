Course Catalog Description:
Principles of software development, style and testing. Topics include procedural and object-oriented programming in the context of real-world applications. This is one of two normal entry-level courses for Computer
Information Systems and Computer Science majors. Credit will be given for only one of CPSC 1010, 1060
or 1110.
Extended Description:
This course is a rigorous introduction to problem solving using fundamental programming techniques: variables, operators, expressions, decision statements, loops, nested statements, arrays, methods, objects, classes,
inputs, and outputs. This course includes programming projects incorporating algorithm design and implementation with a structured computer language and hands-on experience creating, testing, and debugging
software. This course is typically taken by computer science majors, technical majors, or anyone highly
motivated and interested in learning how to program. Students are expected to spend, on average, six to
eight hours per week outside of lectures and labs studying course concepts, practicing programming, and
working on labs and programming projects.
