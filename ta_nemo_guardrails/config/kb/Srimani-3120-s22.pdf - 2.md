AttendancePage 3
Attendance is expected, but not required. We may cover material in an order 
different from any textbook. You are responsible for any material covered in 
lectures. You are responsible for any announcements, assignments or assignment 
modifications that are announced in lectures whether you are present or not. We
will have unannounced quizzes during class; 5 to 10 quizzes are expected 
during the semester. No make-ups will be given.
Deadlines
Work is due at the specified deadline. Late work will not be accepted. If a project 
(homework, programming assignment, etc.) is only partially completed you should 
submit what you have by the deadline. You should expect very little to no credit for 
programming assignments that still generate syntax errors.
Cancellation of Class: If classes are cancelled by the university on the day of a scheduled test, we will 
reschedule the test.

you are expected to work independently on projects, assignments, tests and labs. If you
