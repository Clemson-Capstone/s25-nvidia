CPSC 1900 – Design an Autograder
Before starting this assignment, you should read the 1010 lab document and look at the 
examples for phrases that should appear in student code output. 
This is a two-part assignment where we will be creating an autograder for an old CPSC 1010 
Lab. This lab has students create a program that takes in 9 numbers for a 3x3 grid to check if the 
given numbers result in a magic square (a set of numbers is a magic square if given a set of 
numbers whose values are between 1 and n2 where the rows, columns, and diagonals sum to the 
same value). In the case of our 3x3 sets, they should all sum to 15. 
For this portion of the assignment, you will create a document with a high-level outline of 7
possible test cases for the attached lab assignment. For each test case in your outline, provide a 
unique name and number, a point value, a set of provided input and expected output, and a note 
about any edge cases you may need to consider for that case. You do not need to submit any 
code, but you are welcome to write pseudocode for your cases should you find it helpful. 
Listed below is a set of possible tests, but the design of your test cases is up to your discretion.
Possible Test Cases:
• Check that all required files were submitted to the autograder.
• Compile student code with their supplied makefile.
• Check to see if their prompt behaves as outlined in the Lab document.
• Check that their program correctly identifies a magic square.
• Check that their program correctly identifies a non-magic square.
Submission: 
• Export your document as a pdf named <lastname>_tests.pdf, replacing <lastname> 
with your last name. Submit this file to the correct Canvas assignment by the
deadline.
