Academic Honesty: “As members of the Clemson University community, we have inherited Thomas Green
Clemson’s vision of this institution as a high seminary of learning. Fundamental to this vision is a mutual
commitment to truthfulness, honor, and responsibility, without which we cannot earn the trust and respect
of others. Furthermore, we recognize that academic dishonesty detracts from the value of a Clemson degree.
Therefore, we shall not tolerate lying, cheating, or stealing in any form.”
When, in the opinion of a course instructor, there is evidence that a student has committed an act of
academic dishonesty, the instructor must make a formal written charge of academic dishonesty, including a
description of the misconduct to Dr. Jeff Appling, Associate Dean of Undergraduate Studies. The reporting
instructor may, at his/her discretion, inform each involved student privately of the nature of the alleged
charge. In cases of plagiarism (I.B.2.) instructors may use the Plagiarism Resolution Form available from
the Office of Undergraduate Studies.
Steps to help prevent academic dishonesty are:
1. Familiarize yourself with the regulations.
2. Refuse to assist students who want to cheat.
3. Do not allow anyone to copy any of your work, and report anyone who tries to copy from you to the
instructor or TA as soon as possible.
4. Do not copy any portion of your work from an unauthorized source. An unauthorized source includes,
but not limited to, any webpage, online source, document, or person not affiliated with our course.
