CpSc 4890 / 6890: Programming Team Study Seminar
Instructor: Dr. Brian Dean Spring 2022
Webpage: http://www.cs.clemson.edu/~bcdean/ M 5:20-6:20
Handout 1: Course Syllabus McAdams 107
1 Overview and Course Goals
This course is open to both undergraduate and graduate students interested in improving their
algorithmic problem-solving and coding skills, and interested in participating in Clemson’s ACM
programming team. As part of the seminar, students will learn a number of useful computational
problem-solving tricks and techniques, and they will also improve their programming ability through
individual and team practice exercises.
2 Learning Outcomes
• Demonstrate improvement in their ability to formulate algorithmic solutions to the types
of computational problems commonly found on entry-level programming contests (e.g., the
ACM regional competition, or the USACO competitions),
• Demonstrate improvement in their ability to implement such algorithms,
• Demonstrate improvement in their general problem-solving skills (e.g., visualizing, transforming, and decomposing problems, streamlining the solution process, and simplifying the task
of analyzing the correctness and efficiency of prospective solutions), and
• Understand common algorithmic methods used to solve competitive programming problems,
as well as how these can be often applied to prominent real-world problems.
3 Prerequisites
Students are assumed to be proficient in programming in a language of their choice (e.g., in
C/C++/Java). Advanced topics may assume prior familiarity with some algorithms and data
structures, so students may at some times benefit from familiarity with basic algorithms and data
structures, and with methods for their analysis (e.g., Big-Oh notation).
