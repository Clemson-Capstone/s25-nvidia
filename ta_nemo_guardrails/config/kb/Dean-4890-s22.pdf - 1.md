5 Grading
Grading is based equally on three main components: (1) class participation, (2) participation,
participation in 3 programming contests by the middle of the semester (the ACM regional contest
would be an excellent choice for one of these; USACO contests are another), and (3) targeted
improvement of one’s skills towards the end of the semester. For (3), you should assess the results
of participation in your 3 contests and identify one specific area of potential improvement in your
own skill set; then, you should identify and solve three old contest problems in this area. The
instructor is available to help in this endeavor. Other than these items contributing to your grade,
there are no quizzes or exams. Students in the graduate-level (6890) variant of the class will be
expected to attempt more challenging problems.
Students are expected to attend and participate fully in class discussions and team problem-solving
sessions.
6 Programming Contests
There are numerous high-quality on-line programming contests worthy of consideration for students
in this class:
• USACO (usaco.org)
• Topcoder (www.topcoder.com)
• CodeForces (www.codeforces.com)
• CodeChef (www.codechef.com)
• The Croatian Open Competition in Informatics (hsin.hr/coci)
Students are of course encouraged to participate in numerous programming contests, and also to
refine their skills by solving problems from on-line programming contest archives; for example:
• The ACM ICPC Archive (https://icpcarchive.ecs.baylor.edu)
• The Sphere On-Line Judge (http://www.spoj.com)
• Past Contests from USACO (usaco.org).
