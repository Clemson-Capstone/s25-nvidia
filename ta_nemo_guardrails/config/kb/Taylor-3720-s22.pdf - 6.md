Academic Integrity 
As members of the Clemson University community, we have inherited Thomas Green 
Clemson’s vision of this institution as a “high seminary of learning.” Fundamental to this vision is 
a mutual commitment to truthfulness, honor, and responsibility, without which we cannot earn 
the trust and respect of others. Furthermore, we recognize that academic dishonesty detracts 
from the value of a Clemson degree. Therefore, we shall not tolerate lying, cheating, or stealing 
in any form. Lack of knowledge of the academic honesty policy is not a reasonable explanation 
for a violation. You may not reuse any submissions from another course for any assignments in 
this class without prior written permission from the instructor. Questions related to course 
assignments and the academic honesty policy should be directed to the instructor. Collaboration 
policies will be posted on each assignment. 
Device Usage Policy 
Please silence your devices and do not text or play games in class. Attendance will be taken 
using a web-based system; please be prepared to enter in the day’s attendance code. Note that 
you may be required to have your laptop for in-class quizzes, exams, or activities. Make sure 
your laptop is charged and ready to go for class. 
Accessibility 
Clemson University values the diversity of our student body as a strength and a critical 
component of our dynamic community. Students with disabilities or temporary 
injuries/conditions may require accommodations due to barriers in the structure of facilities,
