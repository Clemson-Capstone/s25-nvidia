quizzes, exams, programming exercises, and collaborating with classmates.
As a courtesy to your classmates and to ensure that every student has the best opportunity 
for a positive learning experience, please observe the following classroom rules:
• Laptop and mobile phone speakers and alarms must be set to mute or turned off 
before coming to class.
• All social media sites, games, etc. must be turned off during class. If you engage in 
unauthorized communication or entertainment during class (e.g. surfing the internet, 
instant messaging, playing games, etc.), you will be asked to close your laptop for 
the remainder of the class period. These activities are distracting to you and the 
people around you. If such activities occur during an exam or quiz, it constitutes 
academic dishonesty (see section below).
• The use of headphones is prohibited during lecture; however, you may use a 
headphone when collaborating with a virtual classmate in a Zoom breakout room.
RECORDING DEVICES
Lectures may not be recorded without the written permission of the instructor, and you do 
not have the instructor’s permission to use notes from the lectures for commercial lecture 
note purposes. 
INCLEMENT WEATHER POLICY
In case a scheduled class meeting is cancelled due to inclement weather, any assignments 
due or examinations scheduled for that day will move to the next regularly scheduled class 
meeting, unless otherwise announced by the instructor.
ACCESSIBILITY STATEMENT
Clemson University values the diversity of our student body as a strength and a critical 
component of our dynamic community. Students with disabilities or temporary 
injuries/conditions may require accommodations due to barriers in the structure of facilities, 
course design, technology used for curricular purposes, or other campus resources. 
Students who experience a barrier to full access to this class should let the instructor know
