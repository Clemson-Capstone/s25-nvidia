Course Description
CPSC 3720 will provide an intensive introduction to software engineering. It will cover each 
major phase of the software development lifecycle. It will provide an introductory coverage of 
requirements analysis, requirements modeling, design modeling, and project management, and 
intermediate coverage of module-level design principles, program specification and reasoning 
principles, and program validation and verification techniques. 
Course Objectives –
1. Understand and be able to explain the software development life cycle.
2. Describe the different practices that are key components of various process models (e.g., 
waterfall, iterative, and agile).
3. Describe how programming in the large differs from individual efforts with respect to 
understanding the context of changes, role of design and modularization, unit by unit 
quality assurance, and reuse. 
4. Using a particular software process, describe the aspects of a project that need to be
