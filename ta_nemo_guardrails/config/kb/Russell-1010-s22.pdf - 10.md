Students who experience a barrier to full access to this class should let the instructor know 
and make an appointment to meet with a staff member in Student Accessibility Services as 
soon as possible. You can make an appointment by calling 864-656-6848, by emailing 
studentaccess@lists.clemson.edu, or by visiting Suite 239 in the Academic Success Center 
building. Appointments are strongly encouraged – drop-ins will be seen if at all possible, but 
there could be a significant wait due to scheduled appointments.
Students who have accommodations are strongly encouraged to request, obtain and send 
these to their instructors through their AIM portal as early in the semester as possible so 
that accommodations can be made in a timely manner. It is the student’s responsibility to 
follow this process each semester. 
You can access further information at the Student Accessibility website. Other information 
is at the university’s Accessibility Portal.Page 8
