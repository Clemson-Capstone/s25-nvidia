MODULES
Modules control the entire flow of your course and its content. You can add 
modules, add items to a module, duplicate a module and reorder all modules 
and module items.
Creating a Module
1. In Course Navigation, click the Modules link.
2. Click the +Module button.
3. Enter a name for the module in the Module Name box.
4. Click the Add Module button.
Adding Items to a Module
1. In Course Navigation, click the Modules link.
2. Click the plus sign button on the module where you wish to add content.
3. Click the dropdown on the Add box to select the type of content 
you want to add.
4. Select the item you want in the list that appears.
5. Click the Add Item button.
Deleting a Module or Removing Module Items
When you delete a module, all of the items in that module are removed, but they 
are not deleted from the course. When you remove a module item, it is also not 
deleted from the course - only removed from modules.
1. In Course Navigation, click the Modules link.
2. Click the Settings button on the module or module item you want to remove 
and select Delete or Remove.
3. Click OK to confirm deletion.
FILES
Uploading Files to a Course
Files uploaded to a course can be linked to or embedded anywhere in Canvas. 
Canvas courses have a limit on file sizes. For videos, we recommend hosting 
in Ensemble. For large files, we recommend hosting in Box, Google Drive, One 
Drive, or other supported cloud services. If the Files tab is visible to students, 
they will be able to view all published files in the course - even if the files are 
located in an unpublished module or announcement. Clemson Online recommends hiding the Files tab from student view.
1. In Course Navigation, click the Files link.
2. Click the Upload button.
3. Locate and select the file you wish to upload and click the Open button.
