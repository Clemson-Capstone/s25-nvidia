Grading Differences Between 4000 and 6000
Graduate students at the 6000 level may have been asked to complete more question and problems 
from advanced material in assignments, quizzes and exams. These questions will reward extra points

graduate students are enrolled in 6000-level session, and all undergraduate students are enrolled in 
4000-level session. If it is not the case for you, please inform me and we may need you to switch the 
session.

wipes for in-person classes. If the mask is required, and a student does not have a face covering or 
refuses to wear an approved face covering without valid documented accommodation, the 
instructor will ask the student to leave the academic space and may report the studentâ€™s actions to
