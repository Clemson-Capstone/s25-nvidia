exams, quizzes, assignments, projects, or lectures is considered an act of academic dishonesty (unauthorized
assistance) unless you have written permission from the instructor. All work submitted for grades should
be your own work, and you cannot copy, paraphrase, or modify any work from an unauthorized source (a
source not explicitly permitted by the instructor). The instructor has the right to run programs to detect
evidence of unauthorized assistance (usually in the form of copying from another person or unauthorized
source) in any assignment submitted by a student in this semester, previous semesters, or future semesters.
Class Accommodation and Accessibility: Clemson University values the diversity of our student body
as a strength and a critical component of our dynamic community. Students with disabilities or temporary
injuries/conditions may require accommodations due to barriers in the structure of facilities, course design,
technology used for curricular purposes, or other campus resources. Students who experience a barrier to
full access to this class should let the professor know, and make an appointment to meet with a staff member
in Student Accessibility Services as soon as possible. You can make an appointment by calling 864-656-6848,
by emailing studentaccess@lists.clemson.edu, or by visiting Suite 239 in the Academic Success Center
building. Appointments are strongly encouraged â€“ drop-ins will be seen if at all possible, but there could be a
significant wait due to scheduled appointments. Students who receive Academic Access Letters are strongly
encouraged to request, obtain and present these to their professors as early in the semester as possible
so that accommodations can be made in a timely manner. It is the students responsibility to follow this
process each semester. You can access further information here: http://www.clemson.edu/campus-life/
