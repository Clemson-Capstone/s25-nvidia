For this course, unless otherwise stated it is considered cheating to do any of the following:
• discuss in detail the code in your program with another person (other than the instructor or the
lab TAs)
• use code obtained from another student, or any other unauthorized source, either modified or
unmodified (each student is responsible for protecting his or her files from access by others)
• use reengineering tools
• submit work of others, from the Internet or any other source
• use unauthorized aids such as the textbook or other individuals on assigned work or exams
A good rule of thumb if you are not sure if an action is considered cheating, ASK the instructor.
If it is determined that you have cheated the consequences will be substantial, ranging from -100 on
the assignment to automatic F in the class.
