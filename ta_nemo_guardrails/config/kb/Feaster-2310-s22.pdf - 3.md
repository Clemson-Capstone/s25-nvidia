class. The programming labs will carry a higher weight than the remaining labs. Each lab instruction
will clearly state if the lab is considered a“programming” or “other” lab type.
Quizzes
We will have several quizzes during the semester. All quizzes will be on a Wednesday. This does not
mean we will have a quiz each Wednesday. I will drop one quiz. Under no circumstances do I do
not allow quizzes to be made up. If you are not present for a quiz you will receive a 0 on the
quiz. At the end of the semester, based on the number of quizzes we had, I may consider dropping
additional quizzes. However, you should only expect 1 quiz to be dropped.
Class Activities/Participation/Attendance
As practice, periodically I will assign 1 or more worksheets during class for you to complete. These
worksheets and class attendance will make up the participation portion of your grade. There will be
NO opportunities to make up the in-class worksheets. I strongly suggest you attend class. Depending
on the actual number of participation worksheets we have, I will drop up to 4 of these participations.
Attendance will count for no more than 3% of your Participation grade.
