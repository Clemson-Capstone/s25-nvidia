documentation need not state the nature of illness, just the dates of the illness. In case of 
other emergency, documentation should state the exact date of the emergency as well.
In case of military deployment/exercises, student must obtain a copy of orders from the CO. If

nor penalized for their attendance. However, students are responsible for submitting all the 
required work before the posted deadline, even if they miss a class, unless they have an 
excused absence and have made alternative arrangements with their instructor.

The Notification of Absence form in Canvas allows students to quickly notify instructors of an 
absence from class. The notification form requires a brief explanation, dates and times. This
