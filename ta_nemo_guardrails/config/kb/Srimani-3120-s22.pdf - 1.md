d. Course Type: Selected Elective
Textbook:
(1) Éva Tardös and Jon Kleinberg, “Algorithm Design”, Addison-Wesley; OR (2) Michael T. Goodrich 
and Roberto Tamassia,“Algorithm Design and Applications”, Wiley; OR (3) Thomas H. Cormen, Page 2
Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, Clifford Stein, “Introduction to Algorithms”, The MIT Press.
[Note: Any of these three books is more than enough to cover the materials of this course; we will not 
follow any particular textbook in class.]
Tentative Outline of Topics:
1. Design techniques: Greedy approach, Divide-and-conquer, Dynamic programming
2. Applications: Sorting, Long Integer Multiplication, Activity Selection (Interval Scheduling), 
Knapsack, Huffman Coding, Offline Caching, Matrix Chain Multiplication, Longest Common 
Subsequence, Sequence Alignment, Convex Hull
3. Analysis Tools: Recurrence relations, Average case analysis, Amortization, Lower bounds
4. Advanced Data structures: Balanced Trees, Heap and search tree variations, Union-Find, Hash 
tables
5. Graph Algorithms: Shortest Path, Minimal Spanning Tree (Kruskal & Prim), 
6. NP completeness and approximation algorithms (Time permitting)
Tentative Grading (subject to change):
The final grade for the course will be computed based upon the following distribution (tentative): 
• HomeWorks – 30%
• 2 Tests – 40%
• Comprehensive Final Exam – 30% 
Note: Homework may include programming assignments.
Class Policy on submission: You cannot turn in work that you have already turned in for credit in 
another course.
Grade Appeal Policy
Any grade challenges regarding exams, quizzes, exercises, or programs must be 
emailed to the instructor, with detailed justifications, within one week of the date 
the grades are available. No exceptions.
