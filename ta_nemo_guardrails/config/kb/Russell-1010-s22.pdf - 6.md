need to vent.
TIP #3: Donâ€™t get behind. 
We will move at a very fast 
pace this semester. Getting 
behind can be disastrous.
TIP #4: Talk out loud about 
what you are learning.
When you practice explaining 
concepts out loud, you start to 
reason about what you are 
learning and probe your own
understanding. Use this to your 
advantage and talk about CS
this semester to anyone that 
will listen, even yourself!
TIP #5: Practice, practice, 
practice.
Coding is a technical skill that 
is developed over time. You will 
need to practice to improve.Page 5

Detailed written instructions, including deadlines, formatting, collaboration expectations, 
and submission requirements will be provided on Canvas for every assignment and project. 
Late work will not be accepted for credit; however, submitting all assignments may work in 
your favor in case of borderline grades. 
PARTICIPATION ACTIVITIES
Participation activities are completed online in the Programming in C zyBook. These 
activities encourage you to engage with the concepts you are learning, rather than just 
reading through the textbook. 
CHALLENGE ACTIVITIES
Challenge activities are completed online in the Programming in C zyBook. These activities 
are like homework, but with immediate personalized feedback. You must get the correct 
answer to receive credit, but you are allowed as many attempts as you need. Chapter 
challenge activities are typically due after all content has been covered in class.
IN-CLASS ACTIVITIES
In-class activities and exercises are typically completed with a partner or as a group, and 
handed in via Canvas or zyBooks. These exercises cover a wide variety of topics and 
formats, including practice with course technologies (Zoom, zyBooks, and Canvas), quizzes 
on current chapter content, and short coding assignments.
