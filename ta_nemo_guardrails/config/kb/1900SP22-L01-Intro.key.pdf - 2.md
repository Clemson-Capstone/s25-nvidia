BEING SAFE
• If you have concerns about a student’s behavior or conduct, report the issue:
• To Clemson University Policy if you feel threatened or that your life is 
imminent danger (864-656-2222)
• To course or lab coordinator or School of Computing administrator otherwisePage 18
EMAIL POLICIES & PRACTICES
• Make sure your Clemson email address is working
• Check your Clemson email address multiple times a day
• All academic-related email between you, faculty, and students must be sent from your 
official Clemson email address.
• Generally do not send email to a students’ personal email account
• Email chains are terrible for TA coordination
• Work with your TA teams to develop a strategy that will scale
• For example: pinned group conversation using MS TeamsPage 19

SAGE ADVICE
• Be intentional with your time, both clocked in and out
• When clocked in, try and cut out distractions so you can get your work done faster and move 
onto other things. Be productive and don’t waste time when on the clock.
• When clocked out, do the same with your schoolwork so you can be sure to leave yourself 
enough time to do your job and have a social life too
