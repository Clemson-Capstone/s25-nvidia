Each artifact will have a written component to be submitted on the
handin page the night before the presentation. The written
component should be professionally composed and could be slides or
some other document appropriate for the type of presentation
chosen. The oral portion of the presentation will be worth 20 points;
the written component 10 points.
Reading and Writing Prompts (30%)
To increase awareness and consciousness of ethical, professional, and
social issues related to the field of computer science and enable
robust class discussions, each week, there will links to several
articles, TED Talks videos, podcasts, etc posted on Canvas to which
you will respond. Each link will be accompanied with a question
prompt that you will respond to with a blog post using the Discussion
feature on Canvas. There will be around 12 weekly reading/writing
assignments throughout the semester. To get full credit, you must
respond to at least 10 of them, each worth 3 points. Remember to
maintain a level of professionalism with your responses.
Participation (15%)
Attendance and contribution to the course community in class during
every class meeting, including participation in and critiquing of the
presentations, will be 15% of your grade. Foreseeable absences
should be discussed with the instructor ahead of time.
For each class missed after 1 unexcused absence, you will lose 5%
towards this portion of your grade. So if you miss 2 classes, the
highest credit you can receive for participation is 10 points; if you
miss 3 classes, the most points you can receive is 5; 4 or more
