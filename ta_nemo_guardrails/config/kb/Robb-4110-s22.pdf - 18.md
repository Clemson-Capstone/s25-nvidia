Academic Integrity:
As members of the Clemson University community, we have inherited Thomas Green Clemson's vision
of this institution as a "high seminary of learning." Fundamental to this vision is a mutual commitment to
truthfulness, honor, and responsibility, without which we cannot earn the trust and respect of others.
Furthermore, we recognize that academic dishonesty detracts from the value of a Clemson degree.
Therefore, we shall not tolerate lying, cheating, or stealing in any form.
A simple definition of plagiarism is when someone presents another person's words, visuals, or ideas as
his or her own. The instructor will deal with plagiarism on a case-by-case basis. I will use, at my
discretion, the Plagiarism Resolution Form. All infractions of academic dishonesty will be reported to
Undergraduate Studies for resolution through that office.
See the Undergraduate Academic Integrity Policy (http://www.clemson.edu/administration/studentaffairs/student-handbook/universitypolicies/academic_integrity.html) website for additional information
about academic integrity at Clemson.
Academic Grievances:
Students are advised to visit the Ombuds' Office
(http://www.clemson.edu/administration/ombudsman/index.html) prior to filing a grievance. After
discussion with the undergraduate academic ombudsman, students should contact Undergraduate
Studies (656-3022) for assistance filing official paperwork.
