When, in the opinion of a course instructor, there is evidence that a student has committed an
act of academic dishonesty, the instructor must make a formal written charge of academic 
dishonesty, including a description of the misconduct to Dr. Je Appling, Associate Dean of ff
Undergraduate Studies. The reporting instructor may, at his/her discretion, inform each 
involved student privately of the nature of the alleged charge. In cases of plagiarism (I.B.2.) 
instructors may use the Plagiarism Resolution Form available from the O ce of ffi
Undergraduate Studies.
Steps to help prevent academic dishonesty are:
1. Familiarize yourself with the regulations. 
2. Refuse to assist students who want to cheat. 
3. Protect your work! Do not allow anyone to copy any part of your work, and
 report anyone who tries to copy from you to the instructor or TA.

4. Do not copy any code from any unauthorized source. An unauthorized 
 source includes, but not limited to, any webpage, online source,
 document, book, or person not affilliated with our course.
5. If you have any doubt about what constitutes academic dishonesty, ask 
 your instructor before you turn in an assignment.
Furthermore, selling, posting, or giving away course content such as slides, notes, or any 
information about exams, quizzes, assignments, projects, or lectures is considered an act of 
academic dishonesty (unauthorized assistance) unless you have written permission from the 
instructor. All work submitted for grades should be your own work, and you cannot copy, 
paraphrase, or modify any work from any source not explicitly permitted by the instructor. The
instructor has the right to run programs to detect evidence of unauthorized assistance 
(usually in the form of copying from another person or unauthorized source) in any 
assignment submitted by a student in this semester, previous semesters, or future semesters.
